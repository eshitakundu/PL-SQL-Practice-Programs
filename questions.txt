4. Write a PL/SQL program where check a year leap year or not. Take a year as user input and check it is leap year or not.

5. Write a PL/SQL program where take a string as input and print the reverse of it.

6. Create a table named CIRCLE with two attributes RADIUS number (3) and AREA number(10,3), then write a PL/SQL program which can calculate area for every radius up to 10 and insert into the table. (Use while and for loop individually).

7. Write a PL/SQL program which can update cost value of corresponding book number of the BOOKS_COPY Table.
    - INPUT: BOOK_NO, NEW COST,
    - CONDITION: Old cost value will less than 450 and new cost value will less than 900 otherwise provide an error message.

8. Write a PL/SQL Program which take MEMBER_ID as input and provide the corresponding MEMBER_NAME, MEMBER_ADDRESS AND FEES PAID.

9. Write a PL/SQL program which can take a String as an input and display it without any space and also count the no of spaces available in the input string.

10. Take an input of any string and display each word in a separate line.

11. Take an input of any Member Number and display the Member Name in upper case and lower case.

12. Write a PL/SQL program which can update the cost of BOOKS_COPY table with 10 more cost where cost is less than 500 and show how many rows are affected (Use Implicit Cursor SQL%ROWCOUNT).

13. Write a PL/SQL program which can increment the value of MAX_BOOKS_ALLOWED of MEMBER_COPY table with 2 where MEMBER_ID = 5, and show a message if update is possible. (Use Implicit Cursor SQL%FOUND).

14. Write a PL/SQL Program using Explicit Cursor and show the Member_ID, Member Name for every attribute of Member.

15. Write a PL/SQL program using Explicit Cursor which deducts the value of Max_Books_Allowed from MEMBER_COPY table. Deduct value means the value that how many times this member accesses the books. After deduction if value of Max_Books_Allowed is less than 0 then do not update it and show an error message.

16. Create a table BOOK_UPDATE with attribute BOOK_NO, BOOK_NAME, INCREAMENT VALUE, UPDATE_DATE and write a PL/SQL program using Explicit Cursor which can update the cost value of BOOKS_COPY table with 10 and 20 where category is Science and database respectively, and if update is possible then insert BOOK_NO, BOOK_NAME, INCREAMENT VALUE, SYSDATE to the BOOK_UPDATE table.

17. Write a PL/SQL program using Explicit Cursor which can display the all information of 5 books from BOOK_COPY table according to the higher cost.

18. Write a PL/SQL PROCEDURE to compute addition between two numbers and use the different modes (IN, OUT, IN OUT) of data type in input variables which are used on creating PROCEDURE.

19. Write the SQL query to show the error of the PROCEDURE compilation.

20. Write a PL/SQL Procedure which take MEMBER_ID as an input and show the corresponding MEMBER_NAME.

21. Write a PL/SQL procedure which take BOOK_CATEGORY as an input and show the corresponding BOOK_NAME.

22. Write a PL/SQL procedure which can take the BOOK_ID as user input and update the cost with 50 more cost in BOOKS_COPY table.

23. Write the PL/SQL function which can compute the multiplication between two numbers and return the value to the normal PL/SQL program which can show the output.

24. Write a PL/SQL function which take COST of the book as the user input and retrieve the BOOK NAME from the BOOKS table.

25. Write a PL/SQL function which take AUTHOR_NAME of the book as the user input and retrieve the BOOK NAME from the BOOKS table.
